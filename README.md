### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Login using SAWO sdk (the passwordless way)
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### My Process

I began with breaking down the project into following parts:
- The banner section
- Dashboard
- Map
- Integrating Sawo
- Implementing  IPIFY

I tackeled these sections one by one making sure to completely optimise each section before going on the next one. As I am not very familiar with using API's in react I did my best to make the project as funcctional as I could in the tight time frame.
